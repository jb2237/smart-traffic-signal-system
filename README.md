Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in C,
integrated with a Flask backend and a web interface.

## Features
- Dynamic signal timing based on traffic density
- Emergency vehicle priority handling
- Priority order of lanes with green time allocation
- Web-based simulation interface

## Tech Stack
- C (DSA implementation)
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to Run
1. Compile C code
   gcc *.c -o traffic
2. Run Flask server
   python app.py
3. Open browser
   http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Project Type
DSA + System Design + Web-Based Simulation
